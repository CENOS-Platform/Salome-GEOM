\page shared_shapes_page Get Shared Shapes

This operation is a special case of <b>Explode</b> operation. It
produces sub-shapes of the exploded shape (the first shape in the list
of argument shapes), which are shared with other shapes in the
arguments. The argument shapes can also be contained in a compound or
group.

To use this operation, select in the Main Menu <b>Operations -> Get
Shared Shapes.</b> The following dialog box will appear.

In this dialog:
- <b>Name</b> is the base name of the resulting shapes.
- <b>Shapes</b> are the shapes to fing shared sub-shapes of.
- <b>Sub-shapes Type</b> is the type of required sub-shapes.
- <b>Shared by all</b> option specifies what type of shared sub-shapes should be checked:
  - \b On: causes to search sub-shapes from the first input shape shared with all other input shapes;
  - \b Off: causes to search sub-shapes shared between couples of input shapes.

\note For the case when "Shared by all" option is switched off - if an input list of shapes
contains single compound, the sub-shapes shared between all possible couples of its top-level shapes
are searched; otherwise, only sub-shapes that are shared between first input shape and all rest input
shapes are searched.
