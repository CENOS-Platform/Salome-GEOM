\page python_interface Geometry module Python Interface

The %GEOM python package essentially contains:

- \subpage geompy_page "Python Interface geomBuilder.py" to perform the following functions:
  - Creating geometrical objects
  - Importing/exporting geometrical objects
  - Transforming geometrical objects
  - Using measurement tools
  - Field on Geometry
- Utility functions to handle %GEOM items in Salome study (geomtools.py).
  See example - \subpage manipulate_object "Manipulate GEOM object in the study".
  - add a shape to a study, remove from the study
  - display a shape in a viewer, erase the shape from the viewers
  - completly delete a shape (undisplay, unpublish, and destroy the shape)
  - helper functions to manage the selection in the object browser
- Wrapping functions to help the usage of %GEOM tools:
  - a sketcher module to create sketches from the python API (gsketcher.py)
- \subpage struct_elem_visualisation "The visualization of structural elements": a function to create
  geometrical 3D representations of mechanical models called
  "structural elements" (package \ref structelem.py "structelem")

The functions are distributed in the python package salome.geom. 
The specification of the programming interface of this package 
is detailled in the part \subpage api_documentation "Documentation of the programming interface (API)" 
of this documentation.


\note The main package salome contains other sub-packages that are
distributed with the other SALOME modules. For example, the KERNEL
module provides the python package salome.kernel and SMESH the
package salome.smesh.
