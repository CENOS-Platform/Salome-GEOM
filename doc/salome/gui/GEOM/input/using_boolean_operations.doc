For detail description of the Boolean operations please refer to
<a href="SALOME_BOA_PA.pdf">this document</a>. 
It provides a general review of the Partition and Boolean
operations algorithms, describes the usage methodology and highlighs
major limitations of these operations.

You can use the following boolean operations for construction of more
complex geometrical objects (2D & 3D elements):

<ul>
<li>\subpage fuse_operation_page "Fuse" - creates a shape from a list of shapes.</li>
<li>\subpage common_operation_page "Common" - transforms the common part
of a list of objects into an independent object.</li>
<li>\subpage cut_operation_page "Cut" - cuts one shape with
a list of others. </li>
<li>\subpage section_opeartion_page "Section" - creates a section between two shapes.</li>
</ul>

You can use advanced TUI commands performing these operations
independently from each other:
\par
<em>geompy.MakeFuseList(theShapesList)</em>, where \em theShapesList is
the list of shapes for Fuse operation; 
\par
<em>geompy.MakeCommonList(theShapesList)</em>, where \em theShapesList is
the list of shapes for Common operation;
\par
<em>geompy.MakeCutList(theMainShape, theShapesList)</em>, where \em
theMainShape is the object of the operation and \em theShapesList is
the list of tools for Cut operation;
\par
<em>geompy.MakeSection(Shape1, Shape2)</em>, where \em Shape1 is the first
argument and \em Shape2 is the second argument of Section operation;


There are several TUI commands that can be used to perform boolean operations
with only two arguments. There is a general TUI command covering these
operations, which can be used alongside with separate commands for each
operation.
\par
<em>geompy.MakeBoolean(Shape1, Shape2, Operation),</em> where \em
Shape1 is the first argument and \em Shape2 is the second argument of
Boolean operation, \em Operation is a type of the Boolean operation (1
&mdash; Common, 2 &mdash; Cut, 3 &mdash; Fuse, 4 &mdash; Section).


Besides, you can use advanced TUI commands performing these operations
independently from each other:
\par
<em>geompy.MakeFuse(Shape1, Shape2)</em>, where \em Shape1 is the first
argument and \em Shape2 is the second argument of Fuse operation; 
\par
<em>geompy.MakeCommon(Shape1, Shape2)</em>, where \em Shape1 is the first
argument and \em Shape2 is the second argument of Common operation;
\par
<em>geompy.MakeCut(Shape1, Shape2)</em>, where \em Shape1 is the first
argument and \em Shape2 is the second argument of Cut operation;

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of the use of
