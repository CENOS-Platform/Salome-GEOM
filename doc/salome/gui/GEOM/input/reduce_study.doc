\page reduce_study_page Reduce Study

The user sometimes needs to keep in the study only some objects that 
present the final result(s) of the design operations and to delete all 
other objects which do not contribute to these results.

The feature is especially useful when the user designs the whole model 
through the GUI and wants to generate simplified "clean" Python dump only 
at the end of the model construction with no "useless" objects in the 
%GEOM module.

User can open dialog box by selecting desirable object(s) in Object 
Browser or OCC Viewer and calling "Reduce study" popup item.

<ul>

<li><b> Objects to be kept</b> - objects will be kept in the study after 
applying operation of reduce study. The list of objects being selected by 
the user are highlighted in bold font.
\n Moreover user can show and hide object(s) in current OCC Viewer using 
"eye" icons near each item of tree. It's possible to click on "eye" icon 
in the head of tree in order to show/hide all objects.</li>

<li><b> Objects to be removed</b> - objects will be deleted by the 
function if it is applied.</li>

<li><b> Intermediate objects</b> - allows to choose future action with
the objects, being in the operations chains to produce final objects:
<ul>
<li>Keep - object(s) will be kept in the study;</li>
<li>Unpublish - object(s) will be automatically unpublished (hidden) 
from the study;</li>
<li>Remove - object(s) will be removed from the study. Since using of 
this option can lead to the broken Dump Python, the warning message 
will be shown to the user.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b> Sub-objects</b> - allows to choose the same operations for 
sub-objects of selected item(s): keep, unpublish or remove.</li>

<li><b> Remove empty folders</b> - if this option is checked, all folders, 
which will become empty after removal of the unused objects from the 
study, will be also removed; otherwise, empty folders will be kept.</li>

<li><b> Soft removal</b> - if this option is checked, operation will just 
unpublish the redundant objects from the study instead of their hard removal.  
\n Soft removal would keep all the data in the study to give the user 
chance to rollback this operation using "Publish Objects" dialog box.</li>

</ul>
