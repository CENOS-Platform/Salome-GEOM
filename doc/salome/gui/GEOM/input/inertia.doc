\page inertia_page Inertia

This operation returns the axial moments of inertia for the selected geometrical object.

The table displays:
 - 3*3 matrix of its own moments of inertia (in cells <b>i:j</b>) and
 - the main (principal) moments of inertia <b>Ip1</b>, <b>Ip2</b> and <b>Ip3</b>

\note The matrix of inertia is returned in the central coordinate
 system (G, Gx, Gy, Gz) where G is the centre of mass of the system
 and Gx, Gy, Gz the directions parallel to the X(1,0,0), Y(0,1,0), Z(0,0,1)
 directions of the absolute cartesian coordinate system.

\note There is always a set of axes for which the products of inertia
 of a geometric system are equal to 0. These axes are the principal
 axes of inertia. Their origin is coincident with the center of mass
 of the system. The associated moments are called the principal moments
 of inertia. The principal axes are not reported by this functionality.

\note This dialog supports navigation through the selectable objects (in OCC 3D viewer only):
- Scroll mouse wheel with pressed \em Ctrl key or press \em "S", \em "P" keys when input focus is
in the viewer to navigate between selectable objects.
- Press left mouse button to select an appropriate object to the dialog box.
.
For more details, please refer to the \em "Functionality common for OCC and VTK viewers" chapter
of the GUI module's documentation.

<b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.Inertia(Shape),</em> where \em Shape is
a shape for which the own matrix of inertia and the main (principal) moments
of inertia are returned.
