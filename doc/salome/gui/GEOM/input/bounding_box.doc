The coordinates of two corners of its bounding box are shown in the table. 

Press \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button to publish the bounding \b Box in the study. 

\n <b>TUI Commands:</b> <em>[Xmin,Xmax, Ymin,Ymax, Zmin,Zmax] = geompy.BoundingBox(Shape, precise)</em>,
<em>BBox = geompy.MakeBoundingBox(Shape, precise)</em>, where \em Shape
is the shape for which the bounding box is computed. \em precise TRUE
 for precise computation; FALSE for fast one. Default value is False.
