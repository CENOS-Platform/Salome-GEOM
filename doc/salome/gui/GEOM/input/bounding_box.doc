\page bounding_box_page Bounding Box

Displays the bounding box dimensions for the selected
geometrical object and creates the corresponding box shape on "Apply".

\note To take into account any possible shape distortion  
that affects the resulting bounding box, the algorithm enlarges 
the bounding box   to the maximum deflection value of 
faces (by iterating through all faces of a shape).
This functionallity is implemented in such a way to have 
a satisfactory performance.

\n <b>TUI Commands:</b> <em>[Xmin,Xmax, Ymin,Ymax, Zmin,Zmax] = geompy.BoundingBox(Shape, precise)</em>,
<em>BBox = geompy.MakeBoundingBox(Shape, precise)</em>, where \em Shape
is the shape for which the bounding box is computed. \em precise TRUE
 for precise computation; FALSE for fast one. Default value is False.
