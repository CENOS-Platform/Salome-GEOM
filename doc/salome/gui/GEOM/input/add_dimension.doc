The dialog is opened from \ref managing_dimensions_page "Manage Dimensions" dialog when "Add" button is clicked.
This dialog allows creating measurement dimension for the selected geometrical object.
The following types of dimensions can be constructed:
<ul>
<li>Length.</li>
<li>Diameter.</li>
<li>Angle.</li>
</ul>

Being constructed, the dimension is positioned by application such that the user is able to see it from the most appropriate angle of view.
The application selects one of the best matching planes allowed for the dimension. If extending the dimension by increasing length of flyouts
make sense, then the application extends the flyouts for a default value specified on the \ref geometry_preferences_page "geometry preference dialog".

Once constructed, the geometrical properties of dimension preview (flyout, plane) become interactively editable in OCC viewer.
For the description of interactive operations please refer to corresponding section at \ref managing_dimensions_page "Manage Dimensions" page.

The legnth dimension can be constructed in three ways: as length on edge, as length between two points and as length between two parallel lines.
In order to construct the dimension, the selected geometry should met the following conditions:
<ul>
<li>Edge length - only the line edges are accepted. E.g. constructed from line segment, on two points.</li>
<li>Two points - any two points.</li>
<li>Parallel edges - only the parallel line edges are accepted.</li>
</ul>

The diameter dimension can be constructed for the following geometry types:
<ul>
<li>Arc and circle. The selected geometry should be an arc, a circular edge or a circular face.</li>
<li>Sphere, cylinder, cone, torus.</li>
</ul>

The angle dimension can be constructed in two ways: as angle between two edges, as angle by three points.
The following conditions should be met:
<ul>
<li>Two edges. The edges should be located in same plane.
<li>Three points. Any three points, with the second point being the center of the angle.
</ul>
