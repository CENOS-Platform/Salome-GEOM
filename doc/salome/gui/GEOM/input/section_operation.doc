To produce a \b Section operation in the <b>Main Menu</b> select
<b>Operations - > Boolean - > Section</b>

This operation creates the section between 2 shapes.

The \b Result will be any \b GEOM_Object (EDGE or WIRE).

<b>TUI Command:</b> <em>geompy.MakeSection(s1, s2, checkSelfInte)</em>\n
<b>Arguments:</b> Name + 2 shapes + an optional flag for self-intersection check.\n
<b>Advanced option:</b>
\ref restore_presentation_parameters_page "Set presentation parameters and sub-shapes from arguments".

\note This algorithm doesn't find all types of self-intersections. It is tuned
      to detect vertex/vertex, vertex/edge, edge/edge, vertex/face and edge/face
      intersections. Face/face intersections detection is switched off as it
      is a time-consuming operation that gives an impact on performance. To find
      all self-intersections please use \ref check_self_intersections_page
      "Detect Self-intersection tool".

<b>Example:</b>

Our <b>TUI Scripts</b> provide you with useful examples of the use of
\ref tui_section "Boolean Operations".

<b> More details </b>

For a detailed description of the Boolean operations please refer to
<a href="SALOME_BOA_PA.pdf">this document</a>.
It provides a general review of the Partition and Boolean
operations algorithms, describes the usage methodology and highlights
major limitations of these operations.
