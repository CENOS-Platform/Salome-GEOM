\tableofcontents

This document determines the range of numbers (tolerances, locations
and sizes) that are to be taken into account for any 3D model design
in Salome. Although it is not obligatory to create models within this range,
algorithms can fail or return unexpected result in this case.

This document refers mainly to Open CASCADE Technology (OCCT). However it
concerns Salome as well as OCCT is a modeling core of Salome %GEOM module.

Any model in 3D-space has its location and sizes. The last two things in Salome
and OCCT are represented by the double precision floating point numbers.

The goal of the document is to define the range of numbers that can be used in
modeling algorithms provided by Salome and Open CASCADE Technology.

\section sec1 Maximal Size of the Model

The Maximal Size of the model is a number defined as the maximal diameter of
enclosed sphere built for the model. In OCCT any model has a location defined
relative the absolute origin. Thus the maximal diameter above should be built
taking into account the model itself and its location.

In Open CASCADE there are two tolerances: Tolerance Confusion (TolC)
and Tolerance Angular (TolA) (see OCCT Precision package for more details).
These values are used for geometric comparisons. They are not used inside
low-level algorithms (intersection for e.g.), where more precise values are
used instead. The value TolC guarantees that the error associated with
the computations for given geometric entity is not greater than TolC.

- TolC - precision value when checking coincidence of two points
  [by default 1.e-7];
- TolA - precision value when checking the equality of two angles
  [by default 1.e-12].

For more information on tolerance definition please see
<a href="SALOME_BOA_PA.pdf">Chapter 4 of this document</a>. To see limitations
that are due to modeling errors or inaccuracies of tolerance usage please
refer to <a href="SALOME_BOA_PA.pdf">Chapter 9.2.2 of the same document</a>.

To provide robust geometric modeling the computations should be consistent,
i.e. the one tolerance value should be used for all computations. To provide
consistent computations the values TolC and TolA should be consistent:

<CENTER><B><PRE>Smax = TolC / TolA             (1)</PRE></B></CENTER>

In accordance with <B>(1)</B> the Maximal Size for the Model is [by default]:

<CENTER><B><PRE>Smax = 1.e-7 / 1.e-12 = 1.e+5  (2)</PRE></B></CENTER>

\section sec2 Minimal Size of the Model

The Minimal Size of the Model is defined as maximal diameter of enclosed
sphere built for the smallest BRep entity of the Model.

All models in Open CASCADE Technology are represented using double precision
floating point numbers. This representation contains approximately 14-16
significant digits.

From the experience of using it is considered that the least four significant
digits contain rounding-off errors occurring during the computation. So
(taking in account the worst cases), there are ten reliable significant digits
for double precision floating point numbers. Having the estimation it is
possible to compute the value of the Minimal size of the model:

<CENTER><B><PRE>Smin=Smax / 1.e+10             (3)</PRE></B></CENTER>

In accordance with <B>(2)</B> for the default value it will be [by default]:

<CENTER><B><PRE>Smin=1.e-5.                    (4)</PRE></B></CENTER>

\section sec3 Full Range of Sizes

The values <B>Smax (2)</B>, <B>Smin (4)</B> are theoretical. Taking into
account the practical purposes of improving the reliability the lower limit
should be restricted by one order. Thus, the full Range of Sizes of the Models
is:

<CENTER><B><PRE>[Smin, Smax] = [1.e-4, 1.e+5]  (5)</PRE></B></CENTER>
