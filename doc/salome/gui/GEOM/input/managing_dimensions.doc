Dimensions of sub-elements can be measured for a geometrical object representing a shape. 
There are three types of dimensions available
<ul>
<li>Length.</li>
<li>Diameter.</li>
<li>Angle.</li>
</ul>

Measurement units and group of presentation attributes for the measurement dimensions can be seen and changed from the \ref geometry_preferences_page "geometry preference dialog".

The application entities, representing the dimensions, are associated with the geometrical object for which its elements are measured. The dimensions follow their associated object on show/hide, transformation and deletion operations.

Each dimension instance has its <i>local visibility</i> flag intended for showing/hiding it among other dimensions of the associated object.

This dialog allows managing list of dimensions for the selected geometrical object.
It shows the list and provides dimension creation and removal, modification of name and visibility, along with the interactive modification of dimension's geometrical properties.

The list view groups dimension objects by their type: "Distances", "Diameters", "Angles". This view allows selection of the dimensions and lets user to change the dimension's name and visibility.

The buttons located at the right side of the dialog have the following purposes:
<ul>
<li>"Add" - opens \ref add_dimension_page "Add Dimension" dialog for interactive specification of a new dimension for the selected object.</li>
<li>"Remove" - removes selected instance of dimension.</li>
<li>"Show All" / "Hide All" - turn on/off local visibility flags of all dimensions presented in the list.</li>
</ul>

Geometrical properties of the selected dimension become interactively editable in viewer.
When hovering with mouse, the element of dimension become highlighted.
This means that the element is ready for interactive operations.

The following interactive operations are allowed:
<ul>
<li>Modification of flyout length. By dragging the flyout with left mouse button the user is allowed to change its length without changing its plane (direction).</li>
<li>Modification of flyout length & plane (direction). If dimension is viewed at least slightly from side, then dragging the flyout with holding <i>ctrl</i> key additionally enables modification of the flyout plane.</li>
<li>Modification of label alignment. By dragging the label the user is allowed to change its alignment. </li>
</ul>

The following horizontally aligned positions can be specified:
<ul>
<li>Left. Label is located outside of the left flyout line.</li>
<li>Right. Label is located outside of the right flyout line.</li>
<li>Center. Label is centered among of the flyout lines.</li>
</ul>

The following vertically aligned positions can be specified:
<ul>
<li>On flyout line. The label is located at the side of flyout line, which is farther from the measured geometry.</li>
<li>Under flyout line. The label is located at the side of flyout line, which is closer to the measured geometry.</li>
<li>In center of flyout line.</li>
</ul>

All of the modifications to the dimensions, until applied, are temporary. The "Apply" and "Apply and Close" buttons save the changes.
